###Filter Graph

Your page will display two things. The first is a graph that displays what filters were used in your most recent feed and how many times they were used. The amount of bars that are shown are automatically adjusted, so if only one filter is used in your most recent feed, there will only be one bar.

###Instagrams Asscoiated with Filter

The second display is for all of the pictures that are associated with the filter that was used most often.
